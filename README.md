# Prostate-Cancer Prediction
This repository contains implementations of various deep learning models trained on the Prostate cANcer graDe Assessment (PANDA) Challenge from Kaggle for predicting prostate cancer. We partnered up to explore different architectures and assess their effectiveness in this critical medical task.

We, Rishi Patel, Rohit Thakkar and Darshil Shukla, have collaborated to explore various deep learning architectures and analyze their performance for prostate cancer prediction. Our joint effort reflects a commitment to advancing medical image analysis through machine learning techniques.

Feel free to explore the models implemented in this repository and provide feedback or contributions to further enhance our research efforts.
